# movie-theater-app
I'm building an app that provides users an easiest way to manage a movie theater. The user can add, remove, and view movies,
showtimes, and seating information. They also can buy tickets and find movies and showtimes by title, time, and date. This helps the users to save money and time while providing the opportunity for businesses to draw in more customers and leads.

To develop this application, I am using Java in an OOP framework. This allows me to create objects that represent different components of a movie theater (such as movies, showtimes, venues and seating information) and define their behaviors and relationships with each other.
